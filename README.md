# A little about me

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @markchous
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating a DnD Manager application. It allows the DM/GM to show images of NPCs and battlemaps, as well as play soundtracks to all users. Will allow for real time character movement on battlemaps at some point. And looking to contribute more to open source.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and Flask to support my DnD Manager applcation.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what I'm looking to do in the future for my DnD Manager application or what I plan to do with what I learn from creating it.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: markhouston35@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm an avid cyclist turned triathlete.
